/**
 * Demonstrates the morphing into greyscaled operation featured by Runigram.java. 
 * The program recieves three command-line arguments: a string representing the name
 * of the PPM file of a source image, a string representing the name of the PPM file
 * of a target image, and the number of morphing steps (an int). 
 * For example, to morph the thor picture into its greyscaled version  in 50 steps, use:
 * java Editor4 thor.ppm 50
 * Note: There is no need to scale the target image to the size of the source
 * image, since Runigram.morph performs this action.
